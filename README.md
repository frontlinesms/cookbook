========

An open document standard for describing automated SMS and Missed Call systems

## The Cookbook format
The Cookbook format is a json document format for describing automated communication systems based on SMS and Missed Calls. Motivating factors in the design of this format are:
- Ease of integration for full import/export in systems that support it
- Human readability, to allow for easy editing directly in json

## This Repository
cookbook.json contains the document format. It is currently a work-in-progress, but when a revision is completed, the repository will be tagged according to the release version.

## TODO
- Link to glossary of terms
- Add dictionary of allowed substitutions
- Add example implementations
